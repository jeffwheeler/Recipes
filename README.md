This library includes a parser that reads a simple YAML-like, domain-specific
recipe language and represents recipes internally with a simple tree structure.
This tree structure can be printed to an HTML table, like those used below the
recipes on Cooking for Engineers.

Here's a very simple recipe:

    A couple things:
      First ingredient
      Second ingredient

      "Mix well!"
